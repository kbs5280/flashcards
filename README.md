# Flashcards

***

* [Flashcards Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

***

### How it Works
<br>
Flashcards is an interactive (REPL) question and answer game.
<br>

Begin the game by entering:

```
flashcard_runner.rb
```

1. You will be prompted to choose a file containing a series of questions.
* You will have one chance to answer correctly before you receive the next question.
* If you want a hint just enter "hint".
* At the end of the game your results will be reported back to you.

### Goals
<br>
In this project, you'll write a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

In order to build good habits, we've broken the project up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility. As you work through each iteration, use TDD to drive out the desired behavior.
